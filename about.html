            <br><p> How are we?<br>
                Two discussions around a coffee was all it took us to realize that not only our ideas were
                aligned and but our vision was game changing material. We had the power to change things.
                What the industry needed was not an evolution but required a revolution. Revolution in the
                way we trade, revolution in the way we exchange data across the globe, revolution in how we
                use data analytics and technology to provide a better, safer, and more efficient global
                environment in trading any commodities worldwide.
                In our experience, most successful businesses find their inspiration from an idea that they've
                given considerable time to developing. We are no different. However, one of the most
                important decisions we ever made as a team, was the decision to launch Havona.

            Back in 2016, our avant-gardist ideas, coupled with blockchain technology as its very early
            adoption, faced lots of walls, and instead of stopping us, it motivated us to work harder.
            Following three years of research and planning, we're now ready to set out on the next step:
            revolutionized post-trade processes

            We live on achieving our vision for people with an ambition, a commitment to excellence and a
                sense of responsibility to leave things better than they found them.
                We work hard every day so that not just but all consumers will have access to terrific products
                at smart prices, always striving for 'leaving no one behind' by building bridges along the way so
                that those who do not yet have direct access can cross barriers and get where we are going
                together as fast as possible! We could not be where we are today without early believers in our
                ideas, partners that challenged us.
